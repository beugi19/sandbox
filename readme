Important commands I learned in Python:

1) ord() sends a character to its ASCII code. Its inverse is chr().
2) x.count('a') gives the occurrences of a inside a string x.
3) Functions: y=list(map(lambda q: [function], x)) sends (x_1,...,x_n) to (f(x_1), ..., f(x_n)) Alternative: "f(z) for z in x".
4) Sublists: y=list(filter(lambda q: [condition], x)) gives the elements of (x_1,...,x_n) that fulfill [condition]. Alternative: "z for z in x if [condition]".
5) arr[-1] gives the last element of an array.
6) To remove non-unique values, use set(). Be careful since this removes any existing order and replaces it with alphabetic one.

Checklist (to be updated every week):
a) Does my program allow for exceptions?
b) Does my program allow for values which produce no error, but don't make sense?
c) Has my program produced an editable output, whenever possible? ("Return" is always better than "print")
